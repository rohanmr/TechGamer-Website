                    <p>Through a blog post, Activision announced that Call of Duty: Vanguard is giving a limited-time Free Access to players for two weeks from March 30 to April 13. The Free Access period will be limited to the Multiplayer mode and include the new maps in Season 2 â€” Casablanca and Gondola. The former is a medium-sized, three lane map that is said to engage players in close- and long-range tactics. Gondola is also a medium-sized, three lane map but one that focuses more on close-quarters combat.</p>
                     <br>
                    <p>A new large-map objective mode set in the Alps will also be available to players during Call of Duty: Vanguard's Free Access period. The new mode comes with the objective of capturing all bases to win the match.

                      <br>
                    <p>Furthermore, Call of Duty: Vanguard Free Access includes a Multiplayer playlist that features maps like Shipment, Das Haus, Hotel Royale, Dome, and Radar. These maps can be played in Domination, Control, and Hardpoint modes.</p>
